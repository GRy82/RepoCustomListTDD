CustomList<T> (-) Operator Overload

Removes or ‘subtracts’ the elements contained within the CustomList<T> object on the right side of the operator, from the collection of elements contained within the CustomList<T> object left of the operator.

Syntax:

       public static CustomList<T> operator -(CustomList<T> listOne, CustomList<T> listTwo)    

Parameters:

CustomList<T> listOne

The collection that will be subjected to a loss of element(s), should it share particular elements of equal value—or hold the same object—as the other collection.

CustomList<T> listTwo

Serves as the collection of values or objects that will be removed from the first parameter, if those values or objects are contained within it.

Return Type:

CustomList<T> 

The result is a collection of those elements contained within the first parameter, which were not present in the second parameter.

Example:

The following example demonstrates how to use the (-) operator to remove items from a CustomList<T>.

public class ManageRoster{

      public void CutPlayers(CustomList<Player> qbRoster, CustomList<Player> cutPlayers){

            foreach(Player player in qbRoster){
                  Console.WriteLine(player.name);
            }
	
	Console.WriteLine();

	foreach(Player player in cutPlayers){
                  Console.WriteLine(player.name);
            }

	//Output:	
            //Nathan Peterman
	//Tyrod Taylor
	//Josh Allen
	//
	//Nathan Peterman
	//Tyrod Taylor

            qbRoster = qbRoster - cutPlayers;
	
	foreach(Player player in qbRoster){
                  Console.WriteLine(player.name);
            }

	//Output:
	//Josh Allen
      }
}
